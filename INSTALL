Installation of GeneMark-HM pipeline

Download the code from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/GeneProbe/GeneMark-HM.git

Copy the content of "bin" folder to desired location.

Software was tested with Perl version 5.10
Perl scripts are configure with default Perl location at "/usr/bin/perl".
The following CPAN Perl modules are required:
* Parallel::ForkManager

NCBI "blastn" executable is expected in shell PATH. 
Alternatively, path to “blastn” can be set directly in "gm_hm.pl" script by modifying the line 
    my $blastn = "blastn";

Download and install database of model files and database of pan-genome sequences.

cd bin
wget http://geneprobe.net/genemark_hm/refmod.tar
tar xf refmod.tar
rm refmod.tar

Pan-genome file is ~20 Gb in size and download can take some time.

mkdir refdb
cd refdb
wget http://geneprobe.net/genemark_hm/pan.fasta.tar
mv pan.fasta.tar pan.fasta
makeblastdb -in pan.fasta  -parse_seqids -dbtype nucl  -out pan -title pan

Pipeline is ready for execution.

To test pipeline installation:

cd test/run
